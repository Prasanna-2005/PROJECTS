<h1>SERVER - CLIENT CHAT APPLICATION</h1>
<p>
This project is based on the client-to-server chat model,where a client connects to and communicates with a server via ip_address and port. The client sends a message to the server, which processes it and then sends a response back to the client.  This application demonstrates the fundamentals of network programming and real-time communication between clients and a server.

<h3>CHAT APPLICATION</h3>
<p>
    On a daily basis, we use various chat applications to communicate with others for our needs. Inspired by this concept, this project allows for the establishment of a connection between two users using a single server running in the backend. Similar to a post office, the server receives messages and routes them to the appropriate users, facilitating real-time communication.

<h4><------CONNECT THE DOTS GAME---------></h4>	
<p>	
    USING CURSES IN PYTHON ,BEING IS ONE OF THE POPULAR TEXT BASED USER INTERFACE-(TUI) SUPPORTNG COLORS 	
    WINDOWS,AND WITH HELP OF SOKCET PROGRAMMING ,THIS GAME WAS BUILT IN A WAY TO CONNECT TWO PLAYERS ,WITH RANDOMLY	
    ALLOTING RED OR GREEN TO EACH ,AND BOTH TAKE 	
    TURNS BY FOLLOW UP, AND CAN DRAW LINES IN THE GRID,ONE WHO COMPLETES THE GRID FIRST,GRID GETS THE FILL COLOR	
    OF THE PERSON WHO MADE THE LAST EDGE.

    <P>	
        CONCEPTS: CURSES/SOCKET PROGRAMMING/OOPS/THREADING	
    </P>	
<P>	
  FINALLY,WINNER IS DECIDED BY THE COUNT OF MAXIMUM CELLS COLORED BY INDIVIDUAL PLAYER.

<P>	
  THIS WAS MY FIRST PROJECT IN CURSES,FELT GOOD IN LEARNING CURSES, GAINED GOOD IDEAS ABOUT BUILDING	
    MINIMALISTIC GRAPHIC GAMES  AND ALSO HELPS IN STRENTHENING CONCEPTS LIKE THREADING,	
    OOPS(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)

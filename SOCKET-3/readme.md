    USING CURSES IN PYTHON ,BEING IS ONE OF THE POPULAR TEXT BASED USER INTERFACE-(TUI) ,AND SOKCET PROGRAMMING 
    ,IT WAS DESIGNED IN A WAY TO CONNECT TWO PLAYERS ,WITH RANDOMLY ALLOTING RED OR GREEN TO EACH ,AND BOTH TAKE 
    TURNS BY FOLLOW UP, AND CAN DRAW LINES IN THE GRID,ONE WHO COMPLETES THE GRID FIRST,GRID GETS THE FILL COLOR

  THIS WAS MY FIRST PROJECT IN CURSES, BEING AN APPRENT IN CURSES, GAINED GOOD IDEA AND THOUGHTS ABOUT TUI
  AND ALSO HELPS IN STRENTHENING CONCEPTS LIKE THREADING, OOPS(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)

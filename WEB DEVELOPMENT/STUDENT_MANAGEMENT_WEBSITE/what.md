<h1>Student Management Application</h1>
This is a simple Student Management System designed to manage student records efficiently. The application provides a user-friendly interface to perform various operations on student data such as adding, searching, modifying, and deleting records, along with downloading the records in CSV format. The unique identifier for each student in the system is the Roll Number.
